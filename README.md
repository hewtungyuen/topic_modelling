# Topic modelling with NLP 

This dataset contains a total of 73537 unique news headlines taken from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/?hl=">Reddit World News</a> channel. 

Our aim is to create a model to categorise news headlines into distinct topics. I used natural language processing and non-negative matrix factorization to build the model. 
The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews">Kaggle</a>.
